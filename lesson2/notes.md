### Puzzle Outline:

* There are five houses.

- Now, who drinks water? Who owns the zebra?

- In the interest of clarity, it must be added that each of the five houses is painted a different color, and their inhabitants are of different national extractions, own different pets, drink different beverages and smoke different brands of American cigarets [sic]. One other thing: in statement 6, right means your right.
